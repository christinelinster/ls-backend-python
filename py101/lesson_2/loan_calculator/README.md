# Mortgage / Car Loan Calculator 

## 1. User Inputs
The program will ask the user for three inputs: loan amount, apr, and number of years. 

## 2. Input Validation
The user inputs will be validated for the correct value. 

## 3. Invalid Inputs
If inputs are not valid, the user will be re-prompted for their inputs. 

## 4. Return Values
Once inputs are determined to be valid, the inputs are converted to floats and passed as arguments to the `get_monthly_payments()` function when called. 

## 5. Calculate the final monthly payment
Once the `get_monthly_payments()` function is called, the user's inputs are passed in as arguments and the monthly payment is returned as a float into the variable `monthly_payment`. 

## 6. Print the results
The monthly payment based on the user's inputs will be displayed to the user.
